# Pump_it_up_challenge
Developed a machine learning algorithm taking part in Kaggle's pump it up challenge to predict state of wells in Tanzania, carried out in Python

The aim of this Machine Learning project was to write and algorithm that would predict the state of wells in Tanzania between 3 levels: 'functional', 'functional needs repair', and 'non-functional'. The random forest was the best-performing model, with an accuracy score of 80.46% on the hold-out set. The analysis was carried out in python.
